      I was born in 1994 in Corpus Christi Texas, but raised in Austin Texas for most of my teen years. Through out my life I have always strived to be great at everything I put my mind to and I don't intend on that changing while taking this program at the University of Texas at Austin. Trying something new and failing is something I am not afraid of because I know im learning and growing, its all apart of the process. And that applies to this program as well, but I know I will come out on top! Ive taught my self how to be more articulate, despite growing up with a learning disability in ADHD. I have taught my self skills that no one around me or in my personal circle could teach me, such as how to create and edit YouTube videos and amass over 5 thousand followers in my first 8 months of starting the channel but I did it. Or how to learn graphic design from ground zero to start my own small in house business, but I did it. I've taught my self numerous skills. But this is different. This is a new chapter in the felid of I.T and it will require some assistance from others and thats okay. Working with others will teach me the ropes of this broad job field and help me hone my newly acquired developer skills to the best of my ability. It short time I will be a developer and you will be hearing from me. feel free to follow along as my skills progress on this site. Applications coming your way soon!
